# Welcome to angular-assessment
angular-assessment is a set of questions and problems you can use, when
interviewing candidates for positions, where they would be using AngularJS.

Tasks you will find in this repository are test-driven. Karma is configured to
run all of them, but it may be useful to you to limit the selection to problems
you actually want to discuss with you candidates.

# How to use
* clone the repository
* customize the list of included cases in `karma.conf.js`
* `npm install && npm test`
